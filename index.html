            Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with 
            support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.
             It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves
             more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.
